Cardi B‘s success has been a sight of the rapper and reality television star and now she can boast of a feat that hasn’t in nearly 20 years. Cardi’s “Bodak Yellow” hit is the first single since Lauryn Hill‘s 1998 smash “Doo Wop (That Thing)” to top the Billboard Hot 100 charts as an act without other credited artists.
