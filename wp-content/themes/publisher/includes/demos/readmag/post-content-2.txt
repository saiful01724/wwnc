If you’re wondering what comes inside the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X retail package, then we have everything laid out in one place.

On the front of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are the 7-megapixel FaceTime cameras with f/2.2 aperture. These are the same specs as on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and, as a result, selfies with the FaceTime camera didn’t look much different.

Now that the iPhone 8 and iPhone X have been announced, more official details regarding the headsets are starting to emerge. We know that the smartphones are the first from Apple that support fast charging, and now we also know what ships inside the box. If at this point you are feeling excited, then you might want to dial down a bit. Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X ship with the same old accessories as before. There’s absolutely nothing new or extra from Apple’s end.

From the front, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus look the same as their predecessors. However, flip them over and you see the gorgeous Corning glass backs. It’s not Gorilla Glass, but a new glass chemistry made specifically for Apple. It has, according to Apple, a 50% deeper strengthening layer.

As soon as I got the blue image inside the circle on my existing phone, the iPhone 7 started transferring setup information to the new iPhone. This included things like Wi-Fi network information and my Apple ID, but not my password or the CSV number for my credit card. I asked Apple for a comprehensive list of what is and isn’t transferred in this process and am still waiting for their response.



The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus screens offer the same resolutions, 1,920 x 1,080 and 1,334 x 750 respectively. As they were with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, they’re great-looking screens, but are starting to seem a little dated in the face of Samsung’s Super AMOLED 2,960 x 1,440 Galaxy S8 displays.

As for noticeable, visual upgrades, the new iPhone display uses a tech Apple calls TrueTone, which uses ambient light to auto-adjust the color temperature of the display to make colors appear consistent across different lighting conditions. In fluorescent light, this made my screens slightly more orange.

If you were hoping for a pair of AirPods with the $999 iPhone X or a fast charger, then you’re absolutely out of luck. Both smartphones ship with the same accessories in the retail package. This includes a 3.5mm adapter, a Lightning cable (not USB-C), EarPods with Lightning and more. Things are topped off with the usual documentation and probably a SIM ejector tool thrown in for good measure.

Given Apple’s drastic migration to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, it boggles our mind why the company is not shipping its mobile products with USB-C accessories. At least a cable and a charger that supports up to 15 watts of power is more than enough to appease users. But apparently, it seems as though ‘courage’ is not anywhere in sight when it comes to such things.

Nonetheless, the smartphones are the best that Apple have made to date. But will the greatness of these smartphones translate into healthy numbers? That remains to be seen. The iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus will be up for pre-order in a few day’s time whereas the iPhone X will go up for pre-order next month. A long wait, but we’ll see if it’s a worth it one.
