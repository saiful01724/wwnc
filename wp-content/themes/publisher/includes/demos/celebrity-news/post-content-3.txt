Fans aren’t thrilled with the price of Kylie Jenner makeup brushes, and beauty experts agree with them. Jeffree Star &amp; more are slamming her for charging $360!

We’ll admit that we’ve spent way more money on makeup than we’d like to admit, but Kylie Jenner‘s newest product is really pushing it. The 20-year-old makeup mogul released a set of brushes, but the $360 price tag has fans and beauty experts alike shaking their heads. Are they made of gold? Do they have magic powers that’ll clear blemishes right off our faces? They better be if she’s charging that much for them — at least, thats what Jeffree Star, 32, James Charles, 18, and other cosmetics experts are saying.

Jeffree took to Twitter to subtly slam the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star for asking her fans to shell out hundreds of dollars for makeup brushes. “Are the new makeup brushes made out of animal hair? Is that why they’re so expensive?? the makeup artist tweeted. “It’s an honest question. Don’t try and make it ANYTHING BUT a QUESTION. I’ll still review it… LOL I ain’t mad.. Just want to know why her team is being lazy,” he added in a second tweet.

Honestly, Jeffree raises a good question. Why exactly do these brushes need to cost so much? Kylie defended the price on her own Twitter, saying that they’re real instead of synthetic, which means they usually cost more. “I always fight for the lowest price on all my products. Here are some other real brush lines for reference,” she captioned a picture of Artis‘ $360 line of brushes. But thinking her price is justified doesn’t mean people who follow her company can afford them. A lot of Kylie’s clientele include teens and young women who don’t have the kind of expendable income needed to purchase this kind of product.



This isn’t the only time Jeffree’s called out a Kardashian-Jenner beauty product. While slamming Kylie for her brushes, he also called out her concealers. In a now-deleted tweet, he accused her of using the same packaging for her new line that he used in 2014 for his liquid lipsticks. He’s also dragged Kim Kardashian, 37, in the past for her KKW contour product.

“Umm… Kim what is going on with those new swatches?? Looks like chalk,” he commented on her swatch test. The issue in that case was Kim just tested the product incorrectly, and she publicly acknowledged her mistake before redoing the swatches the right way.

But even though Kim learned from her mistakes, only time will tell if Kylie does too.

Are you loving or loathing seeing Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Scott Disick, 34, gallivanting around the globe with his new girlfriend Sofia Richie, 19?! If you’re in favor, do you think it has any chance of lasting? Well, apparently Scott is so enamored with Sofia, he’s giving up his longstanding status as a party animal for her, according to TMZ. This is striking because it was Scott’s love for the nightlife that seemed to sabotage his relationship with Kourtney Kardashian, 38, for years!

Their insiders say Scott has found a real connection with Sofia and has pumped the breaks on going out drinking in order to truly be there for her. And, at least for now, he doesn’t see any issue with their age difference. He’s even admitted to confidantes that being with Sofia has “been really good for me.” Wow! This certainly flies in the face of the critics who were convinced this relationship could only ever be a fling! Head here for loads more pics of Scott and Sofia being adorable together!

Taylor also shared her highlight of Bachelor in Paradise, which was something odd he did for her that meant a lot. “My high was something you did not get to see on camera, and it showed me how much he loved me,” she said, laughing. “I am a little bit of a hippie and I make my own deodorant but I used to use lime with my deodorant so one time, at the bar, during one of the cocktail parties, he took a shot and then licked lime juice out of my armpit, and I was like, ‘Damn, I got him, he is in.’ That was definitely one of my highs.”
