Over the decades, smart toys have grown from a niche industry to a profitable business. According to UK-based analyst firm Juniper Research, annual smart toy sales across the globe are expected to grow to $11.3 billion by 2020. Today, toy stores not only have an array of classic board Games and stuffed animals but also internet connected devices, smart racing cars and drones, smart building blocks, and even robots that teach kids how to code.

We saw an opportunity to combine education and play with our Mi Robot Builder, a building and coding robotic toy, which allows kids to develop their own codes and build different models using creative thinking. Our Mi Robot Builder, recently made available on Amazon, one our newest additions to the smart toy market. The Robot Builder is manufactured by one of our Eco system Aiqi, companies which focuses on smart hardware and robotic products.

For kids who love robotics, this toy is indeed a treat. It comes with 978 bricks made from a mechanical transmission structure to ensure effective movement and action. It can be remotely controlled by the Mi Robot Builder app via Bluetooth. By simply dragging and dropping complex command codes to the robot from the connected smartphone, kids can command the robot in three different control settings joystick, gyroscope and route control and can also create their own set of instructions for the robot to follow.

For kids who love robotics, this toy is indeed a treat. It comes with 978 bricks made from a mechanical transmission structure to ensure effective movement and action. It can be remo controlled by the Mi Robot Builder app via Blue tooth. By simply dragging and dropping complex command codes to the robot from the connect smart phone, kids can command the robot in three different control settings joystick, and route control.

The Mi Robot Builder can be compiled into different models including a robot, a dinosaur, and airplane. Each model can reach its self-balance, thanks to an intelligent CPU processor that is developed through a series of balanced algorithms at the heart of the product, allowing the robot to always stay upright and perform perfectly coordinated actions, whether at a standstill or on the move. The robot also comes with four USB type-C ports, which provide power to the robot and support scalable components up to 3 kg in weight.

How you can use this for language learning?
<ul class="bs-shortcode-list list-style-star">
 	<li>Get a set of flashcards for memorizing vocabulary or grammar.</li>
 	<li>Master the hard pinch to activate your body’s threat response.</li>
 	<li>Review a category of flash cards. Don’t pinch yourself at this stage.</li>
 	<li>Review the same category, now adding the pinch for each vocabulary word.</li>
 	<li>Spend some time studying the card before moving to the next one.</li>

The high-power motor, in addition to a built-in photoelectric encoder, allows the robot to have accurate speed and direction. As a result, if motor stalling occurs, a protection mode is automatically triggered to prevent the motor from overstraining. Mi Robot Builder inspires kids to be creative thinkers and builders. It is our hope that this early introduction to technology and problem-solving will allow kids to find a passion for science and technology at an early age, allowing them to realize that the power to create is within them.
