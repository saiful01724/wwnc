Accommodation is one of the biggest fixed costs travelers have and reducing that cost can lead to big savings! Iâ€™m sure many back packers would sleep in a barn if it was the cheapest accommodation they could find!
No matter what your accommodation tastes may be, one thing everyone has in common is that no one wants to pay a fortune for it. In fact, one of the best ways to take a cheap holiday is to cut down on accommodation costs. Since you have to stay somewhere every night, reducing this expense can save you a lot of money off the total cost of your trip. Next to finding a cheap flight, finding free or inexpensive lodging will have the biggest impact on your budget.
