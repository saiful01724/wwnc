Created by Dior’s Swiss watchmaker, the Dior Grand Bal Plume, is the newest creation added to the brand’s exceptional timepiece collection. This new model pairs feather working savoir-faire, an haute couture stalwart, with horological technique.

Limited at only 88 pieces, what’s stunning about the <a href="#">Dior Grand Bal Plume</a> is the design of the malachite dial adorned in gold threads, net, silk, feathers, gems or scarab beetle elytra.

Sunreef Yachts teams up with Infinite Yachts to participate in one of Asia’s most exclusive upcoming marine events – Phuket Rendez-Vous 2018. Managing the Sunreef Yachts Thailand office, Infinite Yachts will first exhibit the superyacht Sunreef 82 Double Deck Houbara at the Phuket Rendez-Vous between the 4th and 7th of January and the superyacht will then make its way to the Thailand Yacht Show from February 22nd till 25th.

The double deck Houbara accommodates up to 7 guests in one beam-wide owner suite, a VIP queen cabin and a guest twin cabin convertible to a double cabin with an additional Pullman bed. The Sunreef 82 DD also features the brand’s signature in-house speciality canoe type boom and carbon mast. Morgan will be producing its first electric model car in 2018 in partnership with industry leaders Frazer-Nash Energy Systems. Morgan fans can expect the new EV3 to be better, reliable and faster, and more. Designed as two separate towers that coalesce into a 300-foot-high cube with a free-flowing curved central void, the Opus will be home to the ME Dubai, which, slated to open in 2018, is the first and only hotel designed both inside and out by Hadid.

The Opus will also offer outstanding dining experiences, with a collection of 15 restaurants, including an outpost of London’s contemporary Japanese robatayaki restaurant, Roka. Culture-seeking guests in search of new luxury experiences and first-rate service will find them at the ME, where a dedicated “aura manager” will enhance each guest’s visit by sharing the best the city has to offer. ME Dubai’s facilities and Aura service will also be extended to the owners

of the Opus’s residences. Of course, the biggest draw to Opus and the ME Dubai will be the legacy of its creator. One of Hadid’s first projects to be realized posthumously, the structure will no doubt serve as a reminder of the achievements of one of modern architecture’s greatest minds.
