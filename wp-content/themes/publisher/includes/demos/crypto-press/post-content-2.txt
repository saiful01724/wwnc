Bitcoin markets are reacting to fresh regulatory comments on crypto from India’s finance minister Arun Jaitley, made during his most recent budget speech in the Parliament today.

Compute profitability by determining the number of days it takes a particular contract to return funds invested. Work out daily returns based on contract’s present hash rate and network.
