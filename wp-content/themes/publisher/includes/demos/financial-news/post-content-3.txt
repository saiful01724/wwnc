Winning customer loyalty is not an easy task nowadays. Companies are spending more and more on customer retention, but it does not help to stop the decreasing efficiency of their programs. It is getting harder to attract clients who appear to lack enthusiasm about collecting points and numerous discount cards.

Bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies have been hit by a range of factors, including fears over tighter regulation and ongoing concerns over digital currency tether and its ability to collapse the Bitcoin market. U.S. regulators are investigating whether the spike in the price of bitcoin in 2017 was the result of market manipulation. On Friday, Nouriel Roubini, the economist credited with predicting the 2008 global financial crisis said bitcoin was “the mother of all bubbles.”

The arrangement, which also includes insurance broker Aon Plc, will help businesses fortify their cyber security defenses and make them eligible to score more favorable terms for cyber coverage, such as lower or no deductibles, along with support services in the event of attack, the companies said. The offering helps to streamline cyber security for businesses, which Hogg said are often addressed in a "siloed manner," with everyone from technology staff to legal departments playing separate roles.

Cyber coverage is a mounting concern for companies worldwide as hackers increasingly take aim at their technology systems. Cyber crime insurance, once a little-known product, has gained traction as hacks involving large companies such as Equifax Inc and Target Corp have become more costly and commonplace. Policyholders that are victims of a cyber attack will receive support services from either Cisco or Aon, the companies said.



Concerns have arisen among credit card providers because their customers have increasingly been using credit cards to fund accounts on online exchanges, which are then used to purchase the digital currencies. A spokeswoman for Chase bank said it is not currently processing credit card purchases of crypto currencies because of the volatility and risk involved, while a Citi spokeswoman confirmed a similar ban, but did not give a reason.

"Across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, we do not accept credit card transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrencies," the Lloyds spokeswoman said in an email. Lioyds did not say how it planned to enforce the ban, although the Telegraph newspaper reported on Sunday that its credit card customers will be blocked from buying Bitcoin online through a "blacklist" that will flag sellers.

U.S. cyber security premiums totaled $1.35 billion in 2016, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That is a sliver of the $244.9 billion in total premiums for U.S. commercial line insurers, but a growing market in which insurers are trying to distinguish themselves. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in June that his company and Cisco were collaborating to get cyber insurance discounts for businesses using their products. He said the combination of gear from the two companies was more secure than competing technology.
